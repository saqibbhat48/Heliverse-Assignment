# Motion Art Effect Clone

## Project: Motion Art Effect Website Clone

### Assignment Overview

For this assignment, I was tasked with cloning the Motion Art Effect website using React, Tailwind CSS, and WebGL. The objective was to replicate the design and functionality of the original website to the best of my ability.

### My Approach

To complete the assignment, I followed these steps:

1. **Design Analysis**: I carefully analyzed the design and layout of the original Motion Art Effect website to understand its structure and visual elements.

2. **React Setup**: I set up a new React project and organized the directory structure according to the requirements of the assignment.

3. **Tailwind CSS Integration**: Utilizing Tailwind CSS, I styled the components to match the design of the original website. Tailwind's utility-first approach allowed for rapid styling without writing custom CSS.

4. **WebGL Implementation**: For incorporating WebGL-based motion art effects, I utilized the `webgl-fluid` library and integrated it into the relevant components.

5. **Responsive Design**: Ensuring responsiveness across various devices and screen sizes was a key aspect of the assignment. I used Tailwind CSS utilities and media queries to achieve responsive layouts.

6. **Testing and Debugging**: Throughout the development process, I continuously tested the website to identify and fix any bugs or issues that arose.
